# Predictive File Cleaner

A Windows utility that helps you identify old and unwanted documents that may be candidates for deletion.

## Features

- Runs silently in the system tray
- Analyzes documents on your PC using predictive algorithms
- Suggests files for potential deletion without moving or modifying them
- Displays notifications with examples of old files found
- Includes a "Check Now" option to scan on demand

## How It Works

The Predictive File Cleaner uses a simple but effective approach:

1. It scans your PC at regular intervals (a few times a day)
2. Uses predictive algorithms and file metadata to determine files with a low likelihood of being used
3. Displays a notification informing you of its findings
4. Leaves the decision to review and delete completely in your hands

The app doesn't delete any files automatically - it just provides helpful suggestions.

## Setup

Download the latest release, place the executable somewhere you'd like to keep it, and run it.
The app needs to run in the background to operate, so it adds itself to your Windows startup by default. If you don't want it to start automatically with Windows, right click its icon in the system tray and disable it.

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or later
